Step 2: -> Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.

Step 3: -> Select the terminal and run the command cd crud for the frontend folder. After selecting the folder, type the next command npm i. for installation of node_modules. -> and run npm start for Frontend Server

Step 4: -> Select the terminal and run the command cd backend for the backend folder. After selecting the folder, type the next command npm i. for installation of node_modules. -> and run npm start for Backend Server
